# TODO

Ideas for functionality to add in the future:

- [x] User `typer` to set up a functional CLI
- [x] Add config file functionality
- [x] Add an ascii view if emoji not available or desired using rich for colors.
- [ ] Add some way to autodetect if emoji available and automatically use ascii
  if not.
- [ ] Use the web-scraping method if there is no PAT specified.
- [ ] Add option to export the contributions by day as CVS and similar
- [ ] when we have a config file, allow customizing the color limits for
  contributions, ie red at 25 instead of 10 etc.
