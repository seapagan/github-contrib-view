# TODO

Ideas for functionality to add in the future:

- [ ] User `typer` to set up a functional CLI
- [ ] Add config file functionality
- [ ] Add an ascii view (optionally colored) if emoji not available or desired.
  User rich. Add some way to autodetect if emoji available or not and chose
  which to use.
- [ ] Use the web-scraping method if there is no PAT specified.
- [ ] Add option to export the contributions by day as CVS and similar
- [ ] when we have a config file, allow customizing the color limits for
  contributions, ie red at 25 instead of 10 etc.
