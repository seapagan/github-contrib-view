# TODO

Ideas for functionality to add in the future:

- [ ] User `typer` to set up a functional CLI
- [ ] Add config file functionality
- [ ] Add an ascii view (optionally colored) if emoji not available or desired.
  User rich. Add some way to autodetect if emoji available or not and chose
  which to use.
- [ ] Use the web-scraping method if there is no PAT specified.
