# GitHub Activity Faker

A simple Python package to generate fake GitHub activity data for testing and
development purposes. This will add random commits (later PRs, issues, etc.) to
the specified GitHub repository.

The generated data is not meant to be realistic but rather to simulate activity
on a repository. As such, it's probably better to use this in a private
repository or a test repository.

## Installation

You can install the package using uv:

```bash
uv install github-faker
```

If you prefer to install it manually, you can clone the repository and run the
following command:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv/Scripts/activate on Windows
```

In either case, you will need to have `uv` installed.

## Usage
